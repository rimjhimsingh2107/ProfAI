### üó£Ô∏è **Hume AI Voice Integration:**

#### **Premium Voice Quality:**
- **Sarah**: Uses Hume AI's "warm_american_female" voice
- **Marcus**: Uses Hume AI's "male_podcaster" voice
- **Natural Conversations**: High-quality, podcast-level audio synthesis
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Hume AI voices convey appropriate emotions

#### **Fallback System:**
- **Browser TTS**: If Hume AI unavailable, uses optimized browser voices

### üé™ **Experience Highlights:**

#### **Natural 2-Person Dynamic:**
- **Intimate Discussion**: More focused than 3-person conversations
- **Better Flow**: Cleaner back-and-forth without overcrowding
- **Deeper Exploration**: More time for each speaker to develop ideas
- **Natural Interruptions**: Speakers build on each other's points

#### **Example Conversation Flow:**
**You ask**: "Explain machine learning"

**Sarah**: "Well, that's a fascinating question about machine learning. It's essentially teaching computers to learn from data, rather than being explicitly programmed."

**Marcus**: "Exactly! And what I've seen in the industry is how this allows systems to improve over time, like how your email filters spam by learning from examples."

**Sarah**: "That's such a great point, Marcus. Think of it like teaching a child to recognize animals - they need examples first, but then start recognizing patterns."

**Marcus**: "Right, and what's really exciting is its application in self-driving cars. They gather sensor data and learn to navigate much like humans would."
